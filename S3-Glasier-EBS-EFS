One word answer: MONEY :D
1 GB to store in US-East-q: (Updated at 2016.dec.20)Glacier: $0.004/Month (Note: Major price cut in 2016)S3:      $0.023/MonthS3-IA (announced in 2015.09):        $0.0125/Month (+$0.01/gig retrieval charge)EBS:     $0.045-0.1/Month (depends on speed - SSD or not) + IOPS costs


EFS:     $0.3/MonthFurther storage options, which may be used for temporary storing data while/before processing it: - SNS - SQS - Kinesis stream - DynamoDB, SimpleDBThe costs above are just samples. There can be differences by region, and it can change at any point. Also there are extra costs for data transfer (out to the internet). However they show a ratio between the prices of the services.There are a lot more differences between these services:EFS is:Generally Available (out of preview), but may not yet be available in your region Network filesystem (that means it may have bigger latency but it can be shared across several instances; even between regions)It is expensive compared to EBS (~10x more) but it gives extra features.It's a highly available service.It's a managed serviceYou need an EC2 instance to attach it toCan be accessed by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously


EBS is:A block storage (so you need to format it). This means you are able to choose which type of file system you want.As it's a block storage, you can use Raid 1 (or 0 or 10) with multiple block storagesIt is really fastIt is relatively cheapWith the new announcements from Amazon, you can store up to 16TB data per storage on SSD-s.You can snapshot an EBS (while it's still running) for backup reasonsBut it only exists in a particular region. Although you can migrate it to another region, you cannot just access it across regions (only if you share it via the EC2; but that means you have a file server)You need an EC2 instance to attach it to


S3 is:An object store (not a file system).You can store files and "folders" but can't have locks, permissions etc like you would with a traditional file systemThis means, by default you can't just mount S3 and use it as your webserverBut it's perfect for storing your images and videos for your websiteGreat for short term archiving (e.g. a few weeks). It's good for long term archiving too, but 


Glacier is more cost efficient.Great for storing logsYou can access the data from every region (extra costs may apply)Highly Available, Redundant. Basically data loss is not possible (99.999999999% durability, 99.9 uptime SLA)Much cheaper than EBS.You can serve the content directly to the internet, you can even have a full (static) website working direct from S3, without an EC2 instanceGlacier is:Long term archive storageExtremely cheap to storePotentially very expensive to retrieveTakes up to 4 hours to "read back" your data (so only store items you know you won't need to retrieve for a long time)
